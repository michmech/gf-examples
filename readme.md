# GF Snippets

This is a growing collection of code snippets which show how to do various things in [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) (GF). I'm collecting these as an *aide-m√©moire* for myself. If you find them useful too, all the better.

- The `rgl-examples` directory shows how to represent a wide variety of syntactical constructions from different languages in GF's Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

- The `rgl-stepbystep` directory has some step-by-step demos of how to build various types of expressions, such as declarative sentences, yes/no questions and imperative sentences, using the Resource Grammar Library (RGL).

- The `orthography` directory shows how to use several orthography-related features of GF such as the BIND token and the CAPIT token.
